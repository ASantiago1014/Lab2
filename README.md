This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that I developed using an Android development tool and is programmed in Java. It is a simple program that pairs you against a computer in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program generates a welcome message on starting the app and prompts the user to choose their weapon of choice between three buttons labeled Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer’s choice is randomly generated and assigned an enumeration for the Weapon object, which is then compared to the user’s choice. The user’s choice is also assigned the chosen enumeration for the Weapon object. The choices are compared and then a victor is determined using the standard rules of the game. The score is then incremented and displayed based on the winner.
